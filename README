This project produces a command line program for controlling
BlinkM leds connected to the I2C bus 3 from a Gumstix Overo 
expansion board.

There are make files for building the project natively on
the gumstix or as a cross-build on another machine configured
to build software with OpenEmbedded.

The cross-build makefile assumes the cross-tools have been 
setup in gumstix OE standard locations with the exception of 
the top directory.

I use a non-standard OE temp directory "/work/overo-oe/tmp".

You want to set this to your ${HOME}/overo-oe/tmp unless your 
tools are also in a non-standard location.

TODO

1. Write script hasn't been tested much.

2. Need to recover the bus after the command to change an led address.
   Right now you need to power cycle the led which is okay, but you
   also need to power cycle the overo or the bus stays hung.
   
3. GetAddress is not implemented. Investigate if I2C broadcasts are
   possible with the overos.
